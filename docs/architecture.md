## Pipeline Overview

    subgraph "Bronze Layer - Raw Data"
        GA4[Firebase GA4<br/>Public Dataset]
    end

    subgraph "BigQuery + Dataform"
        subgraph "Silver Layer - Cleansed"
            FLAT[silver_events_flattened<br/>Unnested GA4]
        end

        subgraph "Gold Layer - ML Ready"
            FEAT[gold_training_features<br/>7-day Windows]

## Data Flow

    participant GA4 as Firebase GA4<br/>Public Dataset
    participant Silver as silver_events_flattened
    participant Gold as gold_training_features
    participant BQML as gold_user_retention_model
    participant VA as Vertex AI

    GA4->>Silver: Unnest event_params<br/>Parse dates, flatten structure
    Note over Silver: View with UNNEST,<br/>type conversions

    Silver->>Gold: Rolling 7-day windows<br/>Feature engineering
    Note over Gold: CTE-based:<br/>date_spine x users

    Gold->>BQML: CREATE MODEL<br/>TRANSFORM + LOGISTIC_REG
    Note over BQML: Auto-scaling,<br/>categorical encoding

    BQML->>VA: Register to Model Registry<br/>model_registry='vertex_ai'
    Note over VA: Versioning,<br/>explainability enabled

## Key Components

| Layer | Table | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Bronze | `events_*` | Raw GA4 events (external declaration) |
| Silver | `silver_events_flattened` | Unnested event parameters |
| Gold | `gold_training_features` | Rolling 7-day window features |
| Gold | `gold_user_retention_model` | Trained logistic regression |
| Gold | `gold_user_retention_model_feature_importance` | Feature weights via ML.GLOBAL_EXPLAIN |
| Gold | `gold_user_risk_scores` | Materialized predictions |

## Feature Engineering

Uses **rolling 7-day windows** instead of static "first 7 days":

```
User A, Week 1: Days 1-7   → Did they return Days 8-14?
User A, Week 2: Days 8-14  → Did they return Days 15-21?
User A, Week 3: Days 15-21 → Did they return Days 22-28?
```

This creates multiple training rows per user, capturing behavioral dynamics over time.
