# Trigger a Dataform pipeline run and block until it finishes.
#
# Invoked by the `terraform_data.run_pipeline` local-exec provisioner as the
# final step of `tofu apply`, so a fresh apply leaves the demo fully built
# (model trained, tables materialized) instead of waiting for the hourly cron.
#
# Uses the Dataform REST API directly (no Dataform CLI): compile `main` into a
# compilation result, create a workflow invocation that executes as the runner
# SA, then poll to completion. Auth is the caller's gcloud token; the pipeline
# itself still runs as RUNNER_SA (named in invocationConfig).
#
# Deps: gcloud (already required), curl, python3 (gcloud depends on it anyway).
# Env:  PROJECT, REGION, REPO, RUNNER_SA  (set by the provisioner).
#
# Retries the whole compile+invoke on permission/token failures, which on a
# freshly created project can appear for ~1-2 min until the runner SA's
# serviceAccountTokenCreator grant propagates to the token-minting backend.
